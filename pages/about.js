        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The best places to appreciate the ninja today are Iga and Koka, the traditional heartlands of the ninja, and Togakushi in Nagano, home of the Togakure school of ninja. These respective regions offer some actual buildings used by the ninja in the past and/or museums which house previously used tools and weapons, thus retaining some level of authenticity.</p>
        <p>The ninja were stealth soldiers and mercenaries hired mostly by daimyōs. Their primary roles were those of espionage and sabotage, although assassinations were also attributed to ninja. Although they were considered the anti-samurai and were disdained by those belonging to the samurai class, they were necessary for warfare and were even employed by the samurai themselves to carry out operations that were forbidden by bushidō.</p>
